Can you find the flag encoded inside this image?

## Hints
- Look through the Least Significant Bits for the image
- If you interpret a binary sequence (seq) as ascii and then try interpreting the same binary sequence from an offset of 1 (seq[1:]) as ascii do you get something similar or completely different?
